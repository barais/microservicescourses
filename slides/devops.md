Delivery Challenges

----

### Definition

DevOps is the collaboration between software developers and IT operations with the goal of constantly delivering high-quality software that solves customer challenges. It has the potential to create a culture and an environment where building, testing and releasing software happens rapidly, frequently, and more consistently.

### DevOps vs. Agile

- DevOps is especially complementary to the Agile software development process.
   - extends and completes the continuous integration and release process
- DevOps enables a far more continuous flow of work into IT Operations
   - Avoid situation where development delivers code every two weeks but it's deployed only every two months

### DevOps Typical Stories


- **Story 0**: Dev and Ops collaborate to develop environment definitions
   - **Value**: Ensures that Dev understands and deals with production-like environments; avoids architectural miscommunications
- **Story 1**: Dev continuously delivers application changes to a realistic environment for testing
   - **Value**: Shared technology ensures testable environments and script reuse for repeatable delivery; Test org always has known good  builds,properly deployed

### DevOps Typical Stories

- **Story 2**: Release Applications from Test /Staging to production
   - **Value**: Shared technology and automation ensures no gratuitous differences between dev/test and prod
- **Story 3**: Collaborative incident management
   - Value: ensures an integrated process for reproducing and resolving defects and issues between dev, test,and ops

----
### DevOps Typical Stories

- **Story 4**: Dev and Ops use the same analysis and instrumentation in dev, test, and ops
   - **Value**: Ensures a common understanding of quality and performance (and no fingerpointing)
- **Story 5**: Manage the entire delivery pipeline with end-to-end visibility and dashboards
   - **Value**: Enables end-to-end delivery metrics and visibility into bottlenecks

----

### The purpose of the deployment pipeline

- **Visibility**: All aspects of the delivery system are visible to all team members promoting collaboration
- **Feedback**: Team members learn of problems as soon as they occur so that issues are fixed as soon as possible
- **Continually Deploy**: Through a fully automated process, you can deploy and release any version of the software to any environment

### Common Attributes of Successful Cultures 1/3

- Infrastructure As Code
   - Full Stack Automation
   - Commodity Hardware and/or Cloud infra
   - Reliability in software stack
   - Datacenter or Cloud Infrastructure APIs
   - Core Infra Services

----

### Common Attributes of Successful Cultures 2/3


- Application As Services
   - Service Orientation
   - Lightweight Protocols
   - Versioned APIs
   - Software Resiliency (Design for Failure)
   - Database/Storage Abstraction

----

### Common Attributes of Successful Cultures 3/3

- Dev/Ops/All As Teams
   - Shared Metrics/Monitoring
   - Incident Management
   - Service Owners On-call
   - Tight integration
   - Continuous Integration
   - Continuous Deployment
   - GameDay

----
### The adoption of DevOps is being driven by factors

- Use of **agile** and other development processes and methodologies
- Demand for an **increased rate of production releases** from application and business unit stakeholders
- Wide availability of **virtualized and cloud infrastructure** from internal and external providers
- Increased usage of data center **automation and configuration management tools**
